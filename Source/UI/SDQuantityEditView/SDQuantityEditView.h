/**
 A UIView that uses a SDQuantityView to adjust the quantity of a SDAdjustableItem.  The class uses a SDQuantityEditViewBehavior
 to determine how the item is adjusted.  That is, if the item is sold by weight it will increment/decrement by .1kg when changed.
 For more information on the SDQuantityEditViewBehavior, see SDQuantityEditViewBehavior.h.
 
 This view displays not only the SDQuantityView but also the total price (and possibly weight) for the current number of the SDAdjustableItem.
 It also has a "done" and "remove" button to commit the changes made to the adjustable item.
